<H2>Scenery &amp; Cockpit import/export scripts for Blender</H2>
<H3>Preface</H3>
<P>This is the final version of Xplane2Blender v 3.10. It's been
tested and works with Blender 2.49 on Mac, Windows, and Linux.
Development of this script is no longer done by Marginal, but
collectively and in an Open-Source manner. So please file requests
and issues at the <A HREF="http://wiki.github.com/der-On/XPlane2Blender/">project
website.</A> 
</P>
<P>Besides the work that's been happening on the Blender 2.49 version
of this script, there's some exciting developments happening for the
Blender 2.53+ version of this script. The goal is, to develop a new,
more efficient workflow for X-Plane .obj creation making full use of
Blender 2.5's new amazing capabilities. The project is currently
hosted on <A HREF="http://wiki.github.com/der-On/XPlane2Blender/">GitHub</A>,
where you can follow the most recent development, feature
suggestions, implementations, Wiki, and other good stuff. 
</P>
<H3>Overview</H3>
<P><A HREF="http://www.blender.org/">Blender</A> is an open source 3D
object editor for Windows, Mac and UNIX.</P>
<P>These Blender scripts export models created in Blender to X-Plane
v7, v8, v9 or CSL <CODE>.obj</CODE> format.</P>
<P>The scripts also import existing X-Plane v6, v7, v8, v9 and CSL
<CODE>.obj</CODE> files and X-Plane v7, v8 and v9 <CODE>.acf</CODE>
airplanes into Blender.</P>
<H3>Requirements</H3>
<P>Runs on Windows 2000 or later, Mac OS 10.3.9 or later, and Linux.</P>
<P>Requires Blender 2.45 or later:</P>

</TABLE>
<H3>Changes for 3.10 Final</H3>
<P>The two major changes since Beta 3 are: 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">support for ATTR_light_level (this
	allows you to assign an object in Blender with the ability to
	independently &quot;turn on&quot; the LIT texture, based on a given
	dataref.) 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Fixed the multiple texture bug that was still present in Beta
	4. This applies ONLY to the cockpit .obj, since it's the only one to
	support 2 textures. Now the script correctly interprets which of the
	textures is assigned to which animated mesh in Blender, and exports
	it accordingly. 
	</P>
</UL>
<H4>ATTR_light_level</H4>
<P>The way you use ATTR_light_level is outlined in detail on the obj8
spec website. That site describes what the resulting .obj file would
look like in a text editor. This script allows you to store that
information in Blender, so that it can be saved as part of your
aircraft's source files. 
</P>
<P>What this feature does is it allows you to swap the daytime and
nighttime (LIT) textures on a per-mesh basis, triggered by a dataref
of your choice. This allows you to, for example, build 3D buttons
that &quot;light up&quot; when their particular dataref is triggered.
</P>
<P>Here's how you would do it in Blender. Let's say we're dealing
with a 3D &quot;fuel pump&quot; button that's supposed to light up
when the fuel pump is on. First, you'd have to have a daytime and LIT
version of the texture. Without ANY CHANGES, this button's behavior
would be such, that when X-Plane goes from day-mode to night-mode,
this button's texture would swap from daytime to LIT texture.
However, you can override this, and cause the texture swap to take
place when the dataref for the fuel pump is called up. With the
button selected (pink) in Blender, call up the &quot;Game Logic&quot;
button (F4 keyboard shortcut). Click on &quot;Add Property&quot; and
type &quot;ATTR_light_level&quot; (no quotes) into the space labeled
&quot;Name:&quot; Then select &quot;String&quot; from the drop-down
menu directly to the left of this blank. Now enter the dataref for
the fuel pump into the blank space to the right. (in this case, it
would be &quot;sim/cockpit/engine/fuel_pump_on&quot;). 
</P>
<P>You can now save this .blend file, and the lighting information
you've entered for this button should be grabbed by the new exporter.
</P>
<H3>Tutorials</H3>
<P>This document is a reference and assumes familiarity with Blender.
 There is a detailed series of video tutorials on YouTube that aim to
provide developers with the background and techniques needed to make
basic planes, and to continue making detailed planes using this
script and Blender.  The <A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Os7O-uPhIHk&amp;feature=PlayList&amp;p=83BC4217746786FF&amp;index=0&amp;playnext=1">first

<P>(Re)start Blender. This file can now be viewed by choosing <SAMP>Help&nbsp;→
X-Plane</SAMP> in Blender.</P>
<P>You can now delete the temporary folder.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>If the above mentioned installation of the scripts does not work,
you can still open these Python-scripts in Blender's text-editor
window, and run each script by pressing “Alt+P.”  This method can
also save time.  If, for instance, you keep the Python-script in one
of Blender's text-editor windows, it is easier to call it up via the
“Alt+P” key command, than by browsing to the appropriate plug-in
via the pop-up menus in the Python window.  
</P>
<P>The two most commonly used Python scripts once development is in
full swing, are the “XplaneAnimObject.py” and the
“XplaneExport8.py.”  I've found that keeping these scripts in a
small window in your Blender project makes animating and exporting
X-Plane .obj's faster and easier.</P>
<H3>Importing objects</H3>
<P>First, move the 3D Cursor to where you want the imported object to
be placed. Usually you'll want the object to be placed at the origin
so just press <SAMP><B>Shift&nbsp;C</B></SAMP> to centre the 3D
Cursor at the origin.</P>
<P>Choose <SAMP>File&nbsp;→ Import&nbsp;→ X-Plane Object</SAMP>,
select a <CODE>.obj</CODE> file and press <SAMP>Import&nbsp;OBJ</SAMP>.</P>
<P>The scenery is imported at the 3D Cursor position.</P>
<P>You can import multiple <CODE>.obj</CODE> files and re-export them
as a single file. But note that the X-Plane <CODE>.obj</CODE> file
format only supports the use of one texture file, so you'll have to
create a single larger file containing all required textures - see
<A HREF="#resize">below</A>. Or you can have Blender create this
single file automatically by selecting all the objects and, in a
<SAMP>UV/Image Editor</SAMP> window, choosing <SAMP>Image&nbsp;→
Consolidate&nbsp;into&nbsp;one&nbsp;image</SAMP>.</P>
<H3>Importing planes</H3>
<P>First, move the 3D Cursor to where you want the imported plane or
weapon to be placed. Usually you'll want it to be placed at the
origin so just press <SAMP><B>Shift&nbsp;C</B></SAMP> to centre the
3D Cursor at the origin.</P>
<P>Choose <SAMP>File&nbsp;→ Import&nbsp;→ X-Plane&nbsp;Plane&nbsp;or&nbsp;Weapon</SAMP>
and choose whether to import the plane or weapon so that the
&quot;reference point&quot; is located at the 3D Cursor (for making
cockpit &amp; misc objects) or so that the &quot;centre of gravity&quot;
is located at the 3D Cursor (for making CSLs and static scenery).</P>
<P>Then select a <CODE>.acf</CODE> or <CODE>.wpn</CODE> file and
press <SAMP>Import&nbsp;ACF&nbsp;or&nbsp;WPN</SAMP>.</P>
<P>The script creates up to three versions of the plane or weapon in
Blender, one in each of layers 1, 2 and 3. The versions in layers 2
and 3 use approximately <SUP><FONT SIZE=2>1</FONT></SUP>/<SUB><FONT SIZE=2>10</FONT></SUB><SUP><FONT SIZE=2>th</FONT></SUP>
and <SUP><FONT SIZE=2>1</FONT></SUP>/<SUB><FONT SIZE=2>100</FONT></SUB><SUP><FONT SIZE=2>th</FONT></SUP>
of the number of faces compared to the version in layer 1. See <A HREF="#Level_Of_Detail">Level
of Detail</A> below for an explanation of why it does this.</P>
<P>Imported planes need some tweaking before you can export them as
scenery or as a CSL object; see <A HREF="#Tweaking_planes">Tweaking
planes</A> below.</P>
<H3>Exporting objects</H3>
<P>First, choose <SAMP>File&nbsp;→ Save As…</SAMP> and save the
<CODE>.blend</CODE> file in the aircraft or scenery folder where you
want the <CODE>.obj</CODE> file to end up. Then choose: 
</P>

<P>
The object is exported in the same folder and with the same name as
the current Blender file, but with a <CODE>.obj</CODE> extension.
Blender may display some informational messages - click on one of
these messages to see which object(s) the message refers to.</P>

Ask yourself the following questions:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Most important: Do you really need
	fully detailed 1024x1024 textures for your plane? Video memory is
	used up by terrain and object geometry and textures. Once you run
	out of video memory the GPU has to fall back to main memory, and
	this <U>really</U> slows things down. One 1024x1024 texture uses 4MB
	of video memory. Some people are running X-Plane on computers with
	only 32MB of video memory, so one 1024x1024 texture at &quot;extreme
	res&quot; in X-Plane uses <SUP><FONT SIZE=2>1</FONT></SUP>/<SUB><FONT SIZE=2>8</FONT></SUB><SUP><FONT SIZE=2>th</FONT></SUP>
	of their video memory. Consider resizing the texture file in an
	image editor program to half or even quarter size. Use <SAMP>Image&nbsp;→
	Replace</SAMP> to use the new texture file. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Does the model have hidden faces?
	Some versions of X-Plane don't handle hidden faces in v7 scenery
	objects very well and they also a cause a small performance hit.
	Look for things like wings or misc bodies that are partially or
	wholly buried in the fuselage and delete any wholly hidden faces
	before exporting. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Do you really need all that detail? Consider deleting details
	like flap tracks, antennae etc before exporting. This especially
	goes for the lower <A HREF="#Level_Of_Detail">Level of Detail</A>
	versions of the plane in layers 2 and 3 which are only viewed in
	X-Plane from &gt;1000m and &gt;4000m respectively. 
	</P>
</UL>
<H3>Creating 3D cockpits</H3>
<P>X-Plane 3D cockpits are just normal v7, v8 or v9 scenery objects
except that cockpits can't contain multiple <A HREF="#Level_Of_Detail">Levels
of Detail</A>, so only objects in Blender layer 1 are exported. If
you want to keep objects in your Blender scene for reference but
which you don't want to export - eg the plane fuselage - then put
them in layer 4 or greater before exporting.</P>

<P>You will usually want to import your plane into Blender to act as

<P>To make your 3D cockpit appear in X-Plane, on the <SAMP>Standard&nbsp;→

To hide the 2D cockpit altogether, also check the <SAMP><FONT SIZE=2>show
cockpit object in: PANEL views, exact forwards</FONT></SAMP> option;
hiding the 2D cockpit means that you no longer have to leave a large
part of the Panel Texture transparent to represent the windscreen,
which gives you more room on the Panel Texture for instruments.</P>
<H4>Cockpit instruments</H4>
<P>To construct moving cockpit instruments paint the
<CODE>…/cockpit/-PANELS-/Panel.png</CODE> texture in an image
editor application and place instuments in PlaneMaker as as you would
for a 2D panel <FONT SIZE=2>(but bear in mind that only the top 768
lines of the Panel Texture can be used in the 3D cockpit in X-Plane
versions prior to 8.20)</FONT>. The Panel Texture can by 1024×<I>any
size</I> in X-Plane v8, and any size up to 2048×2048 in X-Plane v9.
Normally you can only use a single file to texture your X-Plane
objects. But when constructing a 3D cockpit you can additionally use
this <CODE>…/cockpit/-PANELS-/Panel.png</CODE> file - the
instruments that X-Plane draws on the 2D panel will also appear in
your 3D model.</P>
<P>The <CODE>…/cockpit/-PANELS-/Panel.png</CODE> texture doesn't
contain any instruments when you load it into Blender (unless you've
painted them on yourself). This makes it hard to tell in Blender
where X-Plane will draw the instruments. So it's easier if you use a
screenshot of the panel with the instruments drawn on it, instead of
the real Panel Texture. If your display is larger than your Panel
Texture, then this is simple:</P>

<H4><A NAME="order"></A><FONT SIZE=4>v8/v9: </FONT>Drawing order</H4>
<P>The order in which X-Plane draws the animations, lights, lines and
triangles in your scenery or cockpit object usually has no effect on
the appearance. So the exporter optimises the order of animations,
lights, lines and triangles in your object to minimise the number of
OpenGL state changes and therefore maximise X-Plane's framerate.</P>
<P>However drawing order does become important if you use transparent
and/or translucent textures on some of your faces - transparent and
translucent faces must be drawn last, otherwise other faces and
lights will not be visible through them. You should therefore tell
Blender which faces are transparent/translucent using the <SAMP>Alpha</SAMP>
button in the <SAMP>Texture Face</SAMP> Editing panel (<SAMP><B>F9</B></SAMP>)
in <SAMP>UV Face Select</SAMP> mode. The exporter will ensure that
X-Plane draws these faces last.</P>
<P>But sometimes you need even more control over the drawing order -
<I>eg</I> modelling a cockpit with a transparent HUD and (obviously)
a transparent canopy; the HUD must be drawn after the canopy.</P>
<P>You can specify the relative order in which lamps, meshes etc

<H4><A NAME="strips"></A><FONT SIZE=4>v7: </FONT>Strips</H4>
<P>As well as basic 3- and 4-edged faces (&quot;<CODE>tri</CODE>&quot;s
and &quot;<CODE>quad</CODE>&quot;s), X-Plane v7 objects support two
compound types - &quot;<CODE>tri_fan</CODE>&quot; and &quot;<CODE>quad_strip</CODE>&quot;.
These are strips of two or more tris and quads that share common
edges. Because the faces in these strips share common edges, X-Plane
and the underlying OpenGL renderer have a third or a half as much
work to do to render them compared to individual tris and quads. This
gives higher frame rates.</P>
<P>In order for a pair of faces to be considered for inclusion in one
of these strips, the following conditions need to be true:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The faces must be facing the same
	way. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Each pair of faces must share a
	common edge (apart from the first and last face). 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Each shared edge must have the same texture co-ordinates in
	both faces. 
	</P>
</OL>
<P>In practice this means that the texture must be reversed in
alternate faces in the strip. In the case of tris this can also be
achieved by mapping a single area of the texture across all the tris,
with the tip of the tris at the centre of the texture area. Use <SAMP>UVs&nbsp;→
Copy&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Paste</SAMP> from the <SAMP>UV/Image Editor</SAMP>
window to automate the creation of strips.</P>
<P>These compound types aren't supported directly by Blender.
However, the export script automatically tries to spot when it can
use them.</P>
<P><SAMP><B>v8, v9 &amp; csl: </B></SAMP>The performance gains from
using strips are more modest in X-Plane v8 and v9, and for CSL
objects. These compound types aren't supported in v8/v9 objects
(X-Plane v8 and v9 use more advanced techniques) and the only saving
from using strips over some other UV mapping methods is in reduced
&quot;vertex count&quot;. It probably isn't worth going out of your
way to look for opportunities of making strips.</P>
<H4><A NAME="Level_Of_Detail"></A>Level Of Detail</H4>
<P>X-Plane has borrowed the concept of &quot;Level Of Detail&quot;
from 3D games. This works on the principle that when you're viewing
an object from a large distance it can be displayed with reduced
detail without you noticing the difference. By displaying distant
objects with reduced detail we can simulate a more complex scene than
would be possible if all objects were drawn at maximum detail.</P>
<P>Use Layers to draw scenery and CSLs (but not aircraft Cockpits or
Misc Objects) with multiple Levels Of Detail. Objects in layers 1-3
are visible in X-Plane at the following distances:</P>

parameters, <A HREF="#lamps">&quot;named&quot; lights</A> and the
<A HREF="#group">drawing group</A>. You can see an object's
properties by selecting it and pressing <SAMP><B>F4</B></SAMP> to
display the <SAMP>Logic</SAMP> panel. Press the <SAMP>Add Property</SAMP>
to create a new property.</P>
<P>Each property has three fields; Type, Name and Value. If you want
to supply a non-numeric value, <I>eg</I> the name of a &quot;named&quot;
light, you'll first need to change the Type from <SAMP>Float</SAMP>
to <SAMP>String</SAMP>.</P>
