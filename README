Usage:
------

After activation you will find an additional "X-Plane" panels in various places in the Property window:
- All Objects will have this panel in the Object context/tab.
- All Mesh-Objects will have this panel in the Material context/tab.
- All Bones will have this panel in the Bone context/tab.
- All Lamps will have this panel in the Lamp context/tab.
- All Scenes will have this panel in the Scene context/tab.

Before you can start to export Blender scenes to OBJ files you need to create the X-Plane layers within each scene you want to export under the Scene context/tab.

However the panel contents will vary from Object-Type.
As UI-Paradigms are not entirely finished now this is also subject to change.
